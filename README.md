go-deploy is an API that is used to create container applications and virtual machines built on top of kthcloud using Kubernetes with [KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.io/).

It is hosted at [https://api.cloud.cbh.kth.se/deploy/v2](https://api.cloud.cbh.kth.se/deploy/v2) using kthcloud authentication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local environment

go-deploy can be hosted locally using the `setup.sh` script found under the `scripts/local` directory. The script will set up an entire local environment with every service installed in a Kind Kubernetes cluster on your local machine. 

Refer to the [local environment documentation](scripts/local/README.md) for more information.
